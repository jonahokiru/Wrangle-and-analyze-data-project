    "## The objectives of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To gather, access and clean the data (Data wrangling)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To store the wrangled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To do a brief analysis, through visualization  on the stored data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gathering the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data gathering phase i gathered three pieces of the data and presented them in the pandas dataframe. The three dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "was gathered through the following ways;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The WeRate Dogs twitter archived data (twitter_archived_data.csv), this dataset i manually downloaded it from the provided\n",
    "\n",
    "link.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second dataset the image_prediction.tsv , on this dataset i downloaded into programatically using the request library. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The tweet_json.text dataset i stored it using twitter API and python tweeps library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Asessing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality issues.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The columns of in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, \n",
    "   expanded_urls and retweeted_status_timestamp have the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The invalid dog names e.g 'o' in the name column.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The erroneous value '0' in the column values of rating_denominator column.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The incorrect ratings (ratings_denominato !=10)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The column name floofer not well spelled, it should be spelled as floof instead of floofer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In the text column, Some tweets has \"\\&amp\" combined with \";\" which is the html code to display  the ampersand.\n",
